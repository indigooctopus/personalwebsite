  <h4>About Me</h4>
  <p>
    I'm Joseph Owens. I am a Senior at Keene State College who's majoring in Biology with minors in Computer Science and Chemistry.
    <br>I've lived in the small town of Wilton New Hampshire for the past five years. Both of my parents are originaly from Atoka Oklahoma,
    <br>a small town in the far South-Eastern corner of Oklahoma. Four Years before I was born my parents moved to England with my older
    <br>brother when my dad joined the air force. I was born in Lakenheath, and lived in England until a few months after my first Birthay.
    <br>I've lived in New Hampshire ever since, with my three brothers and parents. I've always been fascinated by science, which lead me to
    <br>go into research Biology as a career. I'm also realy interested in History, Geography, and linguistics, and I enjoy hiking, art,
    <br>reading, and gaming in my free time.
